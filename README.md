BackboneDiorama
===============

A client-side web application framework designed for rapid development, using opinionated backbone pattern generators

# Goals
Backbone Diorama aims to assist you in rapid building of client-side web applications. To do this, it borrows much of the 
philosophy of Ruby On Rails, particularly, convention over configuration. Backbone Diorama creates a default Backbone.js
application structure, and a series of patterns useful for typical web development, which are realised through geneators.

# Usage
To view the availble commands, run:

  diorama help

## Create a new project
    
    diorama new ProjectName

This will create a new diorama project inside a directory of the same name

## Development
BackboneDiorama is written in coffeescript and is packaged as an NPM module. To run the development version of the commands without installing from NPM, just execute the commands in the bin/ directory
