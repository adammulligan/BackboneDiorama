BackboneDiorama
===============

A client-side web application framework designed for rapid development, using opinionated backbone pattern generators

## Goals
Backbone Diorama aims to assist you in rapid building of client-side web applications. To do this, it borrows much of the 
philosophy of Ruby On Rails, particularly, convention over configuration. Backbone Diorama creates a default Backbone.js
application structure, and a series of patterns useful for typical web development, which are realised through geneators.
